# GlowingHostel

Guide: Dr. Suresh Jain, Professor, IIIT-Delhi

Tool to visualize energy consumption in a easy to use Visual (three.js) Model using data from Smart Meters installed in IIIT Delhi hostels. Generated a Heat Map to compare consumption in each wing/floor of the hostels. A Django web app that displays the power consumption of each floor-wing of the Girls' hostel with the help of graphs and 3D model of the building supported by color-codes. The color codes determine if the power consumed is higher or lower as compared to the previous consumption. The data is retrieved via SMAP API using python. It makes the consumers aware of their daily power consumption.
